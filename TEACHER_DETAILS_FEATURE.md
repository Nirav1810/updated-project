# Teacher Details Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a comprehensive Teacher Details page that allows admins to view all teachers, then click on a specific teacher to see their classes and schedules.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend - New Component
**File:** `teacher-frontend/src/pages/Admin/TeacherDetails.js`
- New page component that displays detailed information about a specific teacher
- Shows teacher's profile information (name, email)
- Displays statistics cards: Total Classes, Total Schedules, Total Students
- Tabbed interface to switch between Classes and Schedules views
- Classes tab shows all classes taught by the teacher with enrollment counts
- Schedules tab shows all schedules with date, time, room, and status
- Back button to return to teacher management
- Edit button to modify teacher details
- Links to view individual class and schedule details

### 2. Frontend - Service Functions
**File:** `teacher-frontend/src/services/classService.js`
- Added `getTeacherClasses(teacherId)` function
- Calls endpoint: `GET /api/admin/teachers/:teacherId/classes`

**File:** `teacher-frontend/src/services/scheduleService.js`
- Added `getTeacherSchedules(teacherId)` function
- Calls endpoint: `GET /api/admin/teachers/:teacherId/schedules`

### 3. Frontend - Routing
**File:** `teacher-frontend/src/App.js`
- Imported `TeacherDetails` component
- Added route: `/admin/teachers/:id` → TeacherDetails page

### 4. Frontend - Dashboard Update
**File:** `teacher-frontend/src/pages/Admin/AdminDashboard.js`
- Updated "View all classes" link to go to `/admin/teachers` instead of `/classes`
- Changed link text to "View all classes (by teacher) →" for clarity
- This creates the flow: Dashboard → Teachers List → Teacher Details → Classes/Schedules

### 5. Backend - Controller Functions

- Added `getTeacherClasses(req, res)` function:
  - Fetches all classes for a specific teacher
  - Populates room information
  - Calculates enrollment count for each class
  - Returns array of classes with enrollment data

- Added `getTeacherSchedules(req, res)` function:
  - Fetches all schedules for a specific teacher
  - Populates class, time slot, and room information
  - Sorts by date (most recent first)
  - Returns array of schedules with related data

### 6. Backend - Routes
**File:** `attendence-backend/src/shared/routes/adminRoutes.js`
- Added route: `GET /api/admin/teachers/:teacherId/classes`
- Added route: `GET /api/admin/teachers/:teacherId/schedules`
- Both routes protected with `protect` and `admin` middleware
