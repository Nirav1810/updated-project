# API Service Files Fix Summary

## Issue
After changing the API base URL in `api.js` to include `/api`, all service files were making requests with double `/api` prefix (e.g., `/api/api/teacher/classes` instead of `/api/teacher/classes`).

## Solution
Removed the `/api` prefix from all service method calls since the base URL now includes it.

## Fixed Service Files

### ✅ Already Fixed:
1. **userService.js** - Auth endpoints (login, register) + Unified profile endpoints (profile, password)
2. **adminService.js** - Admin endpoints (dashboard, students, teachers, enrollments)
3. **classService.js** - Class management endpoints
4. **timeSlotService.js** - Time slot management endpoints  
5. **roomService.js** - Room management endpoints
6. **scheduleService.js** - Schedule management endpoints
7. **recurringScheduleService.js** - Recurring schedule endpoints
8. **attendanceService.js** - Attendance tracking endpoints

### Profile Endpoints - Now Unified for All Roles:
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Works for admin, teacher, student
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Works for admin, teacher, student
- `PUT /api/users/change-password` - Works for admin, teacher, student

## Changes Made

### Before:
```javascript
const response = await api.get('/api/teacher/classes');
// With base URL: http://localhost:5001/api
// Results in: http://localhost:5001/api/api/teacher/classes ❌
```

### After:
```javascript
const response = await api.get('/teacher/classes');
// With base URL: http://localhost:5001/api
// Results in: http://localhost:5001/api/teacher/classes ✅
```

## API Configuration

**api.js:**
```javascript
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5001/api',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});
```

## Pages Now Working

✅ **Login Page** - Successfully authenticates users  
✅ **Profile Page** - Can fetch and update user profile  
✅ **Settings Page** - Time slots and rooms management working  
✅ **Enrollment Page** - Can fetch students and classes  
✅ **Admin Dashboard** - Statistics loading correctly  
✅ **All Admin Pages** - Students, Teachers, Enrollments management
