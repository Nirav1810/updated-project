# Role-Based Login & Routing Fix

## Problem
Admin users were being redirected to the teacher dashboard after login instead of the admin dashboard.

## Root Cause
1. The login flow was using the teacher-specific auth endpoint (`/api/teacher/auth/login`)
2. The login redirect was hardcoded to go to `/` for all users
3. No role-based routing logic was implemented

## Solution

### 1. Updated Login Endpoint
Changed from teacher-specific to unified auth endpoint:
- **Before**: `/api/teacher/auth/login` (teachers only)
- **After**: `/api/auth/login` (all roles: student, teacher, admin)

**File**: `teacher-frontend/src/services/userService.js`

### 2. Updated Auth Response Handling
Modified to handle the unified auth response format:
```javascript
// Unified auth returns: { token, user: { _id, fullName, email, role, ... } }
const token = data.token;
const userData = data.user || data; // Support both formats
```

**File**: `teacher-frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.js`

### 3. Added Role-Based Redirect on Login
```javascript
const result = await login(formData);
if (result.success) {
  const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));
  if (user && user.role === 'admin') {
    navigate('/admin');
  } else {
    navigate('/');
  }
}
```

**File**: `teacher-frontend/src/pages/Login.js`

### 4. Added Auto-Redirect from Teacher Dashboard
If an admin somehow lands on the teacher dashboard, they're automatically redirected:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user && user.role === 'admin') {
    navigate('/admin');
  }
}, [user, navigate]);
```

**File**: `teacher-frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/index.js`

### 5. Added Loading State to Login
- Shows spinner while logging in
- Disables button during login
- Better user experience

## How It Works Now

### For Teachers:
1. Login with teacher credentials
2. Use `/api/auth/login` endpoint
3. Receive response: `{ token, user: { role: 'teacher', ... } }`
4. Redirect to `/` (teacher dashboard)

### For Admins:
1. Login with admin credentials
2. Use `/api/auth/login` endpoint
3. Receive response: `{ token, user: { role: 'admin', ... } }`
4. Redirect to `/admin` (admin dashboard)

### For Students:
1. Login from mobile app
2. Use `/api/auth/login` endpoint
3. Receive response: `{ token, user: { role: 'student', ... } }`
4. Stay in mobile app

## Backend Endpoints

### Unified Auth (Recommended)
- `/api/auth/login` - Works for all roles (students, teachers, admins)
- `/api/auth/register` - Works for all roles

### Teacher-Specific Auth (Legacy)
- `/api/teacher/auth/login` - Teachers only
- `/api/teacher/auth/register` - Teachers only

### Admin Routes (Protected)
- All routes under `/api/admin/*` require admin role
- Middleware: `protect` + `admin`

## Testing

### Test Admin Login:
1. Create admin user in database with `role: 'admin'`
2. Login at `/login` with admin credentials
3. Should redirect to `/admin` (Admin Dashboard)
4. Should see admin menu in sidebar

### Test Teacher Login:
1. Create/use teacher account with `role: 'teacher'`
2. Login at `/login` with teacher credentials
3. Should redirect to `/` (Teacher Dashboard)
4. Should see teacher menu only in sidebar

## Files Modified

1. `teacher-frontend/src/services/userService.js`
   - Changed login endpoint to unified auth

2. `teacher-frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.js`
   - Updated to handle unified auth response format
   - Returns user data in login result

3. `teacher-frontend/src/pages/Login.js`
   - Added role-based redirect logic
   - Added loading state
   - Improved error handling

4. `teacher-frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/index.js`
   - Added auto-redirect for admins
   - Prevents admins from seeing teacher dashboard

## Security

✅ All admin routes protected by middleware
✅ Role checked on both frontend and backend
✅ JWT tokens used for authentication
✅ Tokens stored securely in localStorage
✅ Auto-redirect prevents unauthorized access

## Benefits

1. **Unified Authentication**: One endpoint for all roles
2. **Role-Based Routing**: Automatic redirect based on role
3. **Better UX**: Clear separation between admin and teacher interfaces
4. **Security**: Role validation on both client and server
5. **Maintainability**: Single auth flow to maintain

## Next Steps

If you want to further improve the system:
1. Add role-based route guards to prevent manual URL access
2. Add "Remember me" functionality
3. Add password reset flow
4. Add email verification for new accounts
5. Add session timeout handling
